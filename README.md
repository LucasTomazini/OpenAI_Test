# OpenAI_Test

This project is an automatic question answering system that reads a PDF file containing a variety of subjects to study and creates an index of pages related to the user's interest topics. The system then uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to search for answers to questions related to these topics.

## Installation

Before running the project, you will need to install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. You will also need to have an OpenAI API key to use the GPT-3 API.

## Usage

1. Place the PDF file containing the subjects you want to study in the project directory.
2. Open the `edital.py` file in a Python IDE or run it from the command line.
3. Follow the instructions in the command prompt to select the pages related to your interest topics.
4. Once you have selected the pages, the system will create an index and prompt you to ask questions related to your interest topics.
5. Ask a question and the system will use the OpenAI GPT-3 API to search for an answer.

## Limitations

This system is limited to the scope of the topics covered in the PDF file. It may not be able to answer questions outside of these topics.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as a test of the OpenAI GPT-3 API and incorporates PDF reading, page selection, and question answering techniques. It was based on the work of other researchers in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence.
